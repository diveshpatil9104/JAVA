/* 
NO MATTER HOW SMART WE ARE ERRORS ARE OUR CONSRANT COMPANIONS. WITH PRACTICE WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT 
    FINDING AND CORRECTING THEM.. 

    - THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF ERROR IN JAVA 
    1. SANTAX ERROR  
    2. LOGICAL ERROR 
    3. RUNTIME ERROR  

1. SANTAX ERROR - WHEN COMPILER FINDS SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR PROGRAM, IT THROWNS A SANTAX ERROR
            Eg ----
                int a = 7          ------>> semicolon is missing 
                 System.out.println(a;


2. LOGICAL ERROR - A LOGICAL ERROR OR BUG OCCURS WHEN A PROGRAM COMPILES AND RUN BUT DOES THE WRONG THINGS..

- MASSAGE DERIVED WRONGLY 
- WRONG TIME OF CHAT BEING DISPLAYED 
- INCORRECT RE-DIRECTS!!

3. RUNTIME ERROR - JAVA MAY SOMETIME ENCONTER WITH ERROR WHILE THE PROGRAM IS RUNNUNG THIS IS CALLED RUNTIME ERROR 

---->> SANTAX AND LOGICAL ERROR ENCOUNTERED BY THE PROGRAMMER WHERE AS RUNTIME ERROR ENCOUNTERED BY USER
