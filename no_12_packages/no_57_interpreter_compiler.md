# INTERPRETER VS COMPILER

**Interpreter :** Interpreter translate one statement at a time into machine code.

**Compiler :** Compiler scans the entire program and translate whole code into machine code.

**Diffrence between Interpreter & Compiler**

**Interpreter :**               
                                         
- One statement at a time.                  
- Interpreter is needed every time.          
- Done partial execution if error.          
- Easy for programmers.                      

**Compiler :**   

- Entire program at one time.
- Onece compile it is not needed.  
- No execution if an error occurs.
- Usually not as easy as compair to interpreter.  


**Is java Compiled or Interpreted ?**
- Java is a hybride language. Both compiled as well as interpreted.

            
             Java File     ------>>       Compiled File   ---->> Can be use by java interpreter        
            (divesh.java)                 (divesh.class)
                                                â†“
                                            byte code


- A JVM can be use to interprete this byte code. 
- This byte code is taken from the any platform ( Mac - Win - Linux ) for execution.
- Hence java is platform Independent.

**EXECUTING THE JAVA PROGRAM :** 
 
    javac divesh.java -----> Compiled. 
    java divesh       -----> Interpretd.


**STEP-BY-STEP-EXPLANATION** 

I'll provide you with a step-by-step explanation of how a Java program, let's call it divesh.java, is compiled into bytecode (.class file) and then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using Visual Studio Code as the integrated development environment (IDE).


**Step 1:** Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

- Before you can start working with Java, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.
Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

- Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install the "Java Extension Pack" from the VSCode marketplace to enable Java development support.
Step 3: Create a Java Source File

- Open Visual Studio Code.
Create a new Java source file named divesh.java. You can do this by clicking on "File" -> "New File" and then saving it with the .java extension.

**code** 
-        public class divesh { 
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, Divesh!");
            }
        }

**Step 4:** Save the File

- Save the divesh.java file.

**Step 5:** Compile the Java Source File

- Open a terminal within VSCode (click on "View" -> "Terminal").
- Navigate to the directory where your divesh.java file is located using the cd command.
- Compile the Java source code into bytecode using the `javac` command :

Command in Terminal : `javac divesh.java` 
- This will generate a divesh.class file in the same directory.

**Step 6:** Run the Java Program

- Run the compiled Java program using the java command :

- Command in Terminal : `java divesh`

- You should see the output :
- `Hello, Divesh!` 


**Explanation :**

- divesh.java is your source code file written in Java.
- `divesh.class` is the compiled bytecode file, generated by the Java compiler (javac).
- When you run java divesh, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode in `divesh.class` and executes the program.
- Visual Studio Code provides an integrated development environment for coding and managing Java projects, including   syntax highlighting, debugging, and integrated terminal support.

- This is a basic example of how to write, compile, and run a Java program using Visual Studio Code. Java is a versatile language, and you can build more complex applications following similar principles.
